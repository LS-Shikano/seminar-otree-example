#This is the pages.py file. Here we structure how our pages and pagesequence function.
#Each page has its own class where you always specify form_model = Player as we have players for each page
#and we have the form_fields in a list which indicate the variables we have on that page. There will be
#more functionality added here but this is a good start.

class EndPage(Page):
    #style: this is a good example of the style 'CamelCase' that one normally uses for classes
    form_model = Player

#Here we define in which ordering we want the pages to be shown. We always start with a Welcome page and end with an End page.
